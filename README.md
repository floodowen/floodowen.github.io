# _ About me_

My name is Owen Flood and I am a Master's student in the Environmental 
Science and Policy MPA program. I am from Silver Spring, Maryland, and I 
recently completed a Bachelor of Science at the University of Maryland, 
College Park in Environmental Science and Policy with a concentration in 
Global Environmental Change.

I hope to work in the climate change resilience field after graduation, 
specifically in coastal environments
